### Security Measures 
##### Encryption
(Explain how encryption is used in the DESFire Object portion of NXP cards)

##### UID
Unique IDs (UIDs) in access cards refer to the first sector (sector 0) on NFC tags. This sector is initialized with a randomly-generated (or sequentially-generated, if specially requested) 4 or 7 byte ID from the factory. Once that sector is written, it cannot be modified again on normal cards. This prevents normal cards from acting as clone cards.

The purpose of a UID is to give each card a unique value to use for authentication/authorization. The ID is read by the reader and transmitted to an identity server or a simple database over OSDP/Wiegand. The server then compares between the received ID and the stored ID and access is granted or denied per the server's response.

Special cards known as [[Magic Cards]] do exist in-which sector 0 is fully modifiable. Having a modifiable UID would allow an attacker to simply copy anyone's UID and impersonate them.

UIDs are often referred to as a card's *serial number.*
