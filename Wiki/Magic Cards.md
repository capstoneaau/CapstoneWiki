"Magic" or "UID-writable" cards are NFC tags that allow for the first sector (sector 0) to be written to, opposed to standard cards. Most (from conjecture) security systems only perform a simple check against the UID on the card vs the one stored on the authentication server (blindly trusting the UID).
